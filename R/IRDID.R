#' index of relative difference
#' 
#' @description Calculate the relative percent difference between two population structures. A returned 
#' value of zero means that the two population have identical structure. A value of 100 means
#' that the populations have no overlap at all (not likely for populations structured only by age).
#' 
#' @details We assume that the populations are ordered in the same way and 
#' that said ordering happens before this function is called. We only check here that the vectors
#' are of the same length. The input arguments could indeed be popualtions structured on multiple
#' variables (more than just age), as long as they are ordered in the same way. It is advised to lower 
#' the open age group for this method because each age has the same weight. Ages where one population 
#' has a zero count and the other does not are thrown out.

#' @param pop1 numeric vector of counts from population 1
#' @param pop2 numeric vector of counts from population 2
#' 
#' @return an index value ranging from 0 to infinity.

#' index of dissimilarity
#' 
#' @description Calculate the index of dissimilarity between two population structures. A returned 
#' value of zero means that the two population have identical structure. A value of 100 means
#' that the populations have no overlap at all (not likely for populations structured only by age). 
#' This is a simple measure of distribution overlap on the absolute scale.
