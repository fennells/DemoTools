\title{index of dissimilarity}
\usage{
ID(pop1, pop2)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop1}{numeric vector of counts from population 1}

\item{pop2}{numeric vector of counts from population 2}
}
\value{
an index value ranging from 0 to 100.
}
\description{
Calculate the index of dissimilarity between two population structures. A returned 
value of zero means that the two population have identical structure. A value of 100 means
that the populations have no overlap at all (not likely for populations structured only by age). 
This is a simple measure of distribution overlap on the absolute scale.
}
\details{
We assume that the populations are ordered in the same way and 
that said ordering happens before this function is called. We only check here that the vectors
are of the same length. The input arguments could indeed be popualtions structured on multiple
variables (more than just age), as long as they are ordered in the same way.

ID(pop1, pop2)     # 5.5 reproduces table 7.20 of Siegel & Swanson (2004)
ID(pop1, pop1)     # identical = 0
ID(pop1, pop2 * 2) # scale invariant
pop3 <- pop4         <- pop1
pop3[1:5]            <- 0
pop4[6:length(pop4)] <- 0
ID(pop3, pop4)     # no overlap = 100.
