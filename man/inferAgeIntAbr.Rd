\title{infer abridged age groups widths}
\usage{
inferAgeIntAbr(Age, vec, OAG = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Age}{integer vector. Lower bound of each age group.}

\item{vec}{any vector, presumably a count, rate, or similar.}

\item{OAG}{logical (default \code{FALSE}). Is the final age group open?}
}
\value{
an integer vector of \code{length(vec)} indicating the width of the abridged age group that each 
vector element corresponds to.
}
\description{
This function is an auxiliary used by top level functions where it is 
guaranteed that age groups are standard abridged age groups. If \code{Age} is specified,
this will work as well for other age groupings.
}
\details{
If based soley on the length of a vector, this will give erroneous results if ages 
are anything other than standard abridged ages groups. If the final age group is open, the 
interval with is defined as \code{NA}. \code{Inf} or \code{-1} would have 
also been a good choice, but we went with \code{NA}.
}
\examples{
vec <- runif(20)
inferAgeIntAbr(vec)
inferAgeIntAbr(vec, OAG = TRUE)
}
