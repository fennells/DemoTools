\title{Coale-Demeny 4a1 as function of m0, region, and sex}
\usage{
geta1_4CD(M0, IMR = NA, Sex = "M", region = "W")
}
\arguments{
\item{M0}{numeric. Event exposure infant mortality rate}

\item{IMR}{numeric. Optional. q0, the death probability in first year of life, in case available separately.}

\item{Sex}{character. \code{"m"}, \code{"f"} or \code{"b"} for male, female, or both.}

\item{region}{character. \code{"n"}, \code{"e"}, \code{"s"} or \code{"w"} for North, East, South, or West.}
}
\value{
a0 the average age at death in the first year of life.
}
\description{
Coale-Demeny 4a1. This is just a rule of thumb. 
In this and some other older texts, 4a1 is known as a 'separation factor'. These coefficients
were pulled from the PAS spreadsheets \code{LTPOPDTH.XLS} and not located in the original
Manual X.
}
\details{
If sex is given as both, \code{"b"}, then female 
values are taken, per the PAS spreadsheet. This function is not vectorized. 
If \code{IMR} is not given, then \code{M0} is used in its stead.
